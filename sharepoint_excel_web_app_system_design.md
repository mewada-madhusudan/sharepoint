# SharePoint Excel Web App - System Design

## Implementation Approach

We will build a React-based web application with an Excel-like interface that supports dual data storage modes: SharePoint Online integration and local SQLite database. The architecture uses a modular approach with adapter patterns to seamlessly switch between storage backends.

### Key Technical Decisions:

1. **Frontend Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript for type safety and modern React features
2. **Spreadsheet Component**: react-spreadsheet for Excel-like functionality with formula support
3. **State Management**: Zustand for lightweight, scalable state management
4. **Backend**: Node.js Express server with adapter pattern for dual storage support
5. **Authentication**: Microsoft Graph SDK for SharePoint mode, JWT for SQLite mode
6. **Data Layer**: Repository pattern with SharePoint REST API and SQLite adapters
7. **UI Framework**: Shadcn-ui with Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive design

### Architecture Patterns:
- **Adapter Pattern**: For storage abstraction between SharePoint and SQLite
- **Repository Pattern**: For data access layer abstraction
- **Factory Pattern**: For creating storage-specific services
- **Observer Pattern**: For real-time updates and synchronization
- **Command Pattern**: For undo/redo functionality

## Technology Stack

### Frontend:
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- react-spreadsheet for grid functionality
- Zustand for state management
- React Router for navigation
- Microsoft Graph SDK for SharePoint integration
- Axios for HTTP requests
- Shadcn-ui + Tailwind CSS for UI components

### Backend:
- Node.js with Express.js
- SQLite3 with better-sqlite3 for local database
- Microsoft Graph API for SharePoint integration
- JWT for local authentication
- bcrypt for password hashing
- cors and helmet for security

### Development Tools:
- Vite for build tooling
- Jest + React Testing Library for testing
- ESLint + Prettier for code quality
- Docker for containerization

## Data Structures and Interfaces

The system uses a unified data model that works with both SharePoint lists and SQLite tables, with adapters handling the storage-specific implementations.

## Program Call Flow

The application follows a clear request flow from the React frontend through the service layer to either SharePoint or SQLite storage, with proper error handling and caching at each level.

## Storage Mode Comparison

### SharePoint Mode:
- **Advantages**: Enterprise integration, built-in collaboration, version history, enterprise security
- **Use Cases**: Corporate environments, team collaboration, existing SharePoint infrastructure
- **Authentication**: Microsoft 365/Azure AD with Graph API

### SQLite Mode:
- **Advantages**: Offline capability, fast local operations, no external dependencies, simple deployment
- **Use Cases**: Standalone applications, offline scenarios, development/testing
- **Authentication**: Local JWT-based authentication

## Security Considerations

### SharePoint Mode:
- Microsoft Graph API security with OAuth 2.0
- Row-level security through SharePoint permissions
- Enterprise compliance (GDPR, HIPAA ready)
- Audit logging through SharePoint

### SQLite Mode:
- JWT token authentication with refresh tokens
- Bcrypt password hashing
- Local data encryption at rest
- Rate limiting and input validation
- HTTPS enforcement

## Performance Optimization

- Virtual scrolling for large datasets (>1000 rows)
- Lazy loading with pagination
- Debounced API calls for real-time updates
- IndexedDB caching for offline capabilities
- WebSocket connections for real-time collaboration
- CDN deployment for static assets

## Scalability Planning

### Horizontal Scaling:
- Stateless backend services for load balancing
- Redis for session management in multi-instance deployments
- Database connection pooling
- API rate limiting and throttling

### Vertical Scaling:
- Optimized SQL queries with proper indexing
- Memory-efficient data structures
- Chunked data loading for large datasets
- Background processing for heavy operations

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment:
- Local development with SQLite mode
- Hot reloading with Vite
- Local SharePoint development tenant

### Production Options:

#### Cloud Deployment (Recommended):
- **Frontend**: Vercel/Netlify for React app
- **Backend**: Railway/Render for Node.js API
- **Database**: SQLite file storage or Azure SQL for SharePoint mode

#### Self-Hosted Deployment:
- Docker containers with docker-compose
- Nginx reverse proxy
- SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt
- Backup strategies for SQLite files

#### Enterprise Deployment:
- Azure App Service for SharePoint integration
- Azure AD authentication
- Application Insights for monitoring
- Azure CDN for global distribution

## Error Handling and Monitoring

- Comprehensive error boundaries in React
- Structured logging with Winston
- Application monitoring with performance metrics
- User-friendly error messages with recovery suggestions
- Offline detection and graceful degradation

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time collaboration with WebRTC
- Advanced Excel features (pivot tables, charts)
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
- Plugin system for custom functions
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Integration with other Microsoft 365 services

## Anything UNCLEAR

The following aspects may need clarification during implementation:

1. **SharePoint List Schema**: Specific field types and constraints for different data types
2. **Offline Synchronization**: Conflict resolution strategy when reconnecting to SharePoint
3. **Performance Requirements**: Specific SLA requirements for large dataset operations
4. **Compliance Requirements**: Specific security and audit requirements for enterprise deployment
5. **Migration Strategy**: How to migrate existing Excel files to the web application
6. **Custom Formulas**: Which Excel formulas need to be supported vs. web-specific calculations
7. **File Import/Export**: Support for Excel file formats (.xlsx, .csv) and conversion requirements
